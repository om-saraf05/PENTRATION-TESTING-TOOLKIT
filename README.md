Penetration Testing Toolkit is a collection of software tools and scripts used by cybersecurity professionals to test, evaluate, and strengthen the security posture of systems and networks by simulating real-world attacks. key Components of a Penetration Testing Toolkit: Information Gathering Tools Examples: Nmap, Recon-ng, theHarvester Use: Scan networks, discover hosts and services, gather public data. Vulnerability Scanners Examples: Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto Use:Identify known vulnerabilities in web servers, systems, and applications. Exploitation Tools Examples: Metasploit Framework, BeEF, sqlmap Use: Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access or escalate privileges. Password Cracking Tools Examples: John the Ripper, Hashcat, Hydra Use: Crack passwords or test password strength using brute-force or dictionary attacks. Wireless Attacking Tools Examples: Aircrack-ng, Wireshark, Kismet Use: Monitor and attack Wi-Fi networks (WEP/WPA/WPA2). Social Engineering Tools Examples: Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET) Use: Simulate phishing attacks and other human-based vulnerabilities.
